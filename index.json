When annotations are not already available, images must be manually annotated introducing costs that can possibly be very high. Furthermore, in some contexts also gathering valuable images could be impractical for reasons related to privacy, copyright and security. To overcome these limitations the research community has started to take interest in creating virtual environments for the generation of automatically annotated training samples. In previous literature, using a graphics engine for augmenting a training dataset has been proven a valid solution. In this work, we applied the virtual environment to approach to a not yet considered task: the detection of personal protection equipment. The first contribution is V-DAENY, a plugin for GTA-V, a famous videogame. V-DAENY allows the creation of scenario with the possibility of customizing most aspects of it: number of people, their equipment and behavior, weather conditions and time of day. With V-DAENY, we automatically generated over 140,000 annotated images in several locations of the game map and with different weather conditions.\nGitHub page: https://github.com/enricomeloni/GTA5_Mods\n","date":1593006481,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593006481,"objectID":"4552ccaa960989401f27d46d4a2c98e0","permalink":"https://enricomeloni.github.io/project/daeny/","publishdate":"2020-06-24T15:48:01+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/daeny/","section":"project","summary":"A Dataset Generator powered by a modded version of GTA V","tags":["virtual environments","computer vision","gta5","c#","YOLO","machine learning","object detection"],"title":"Object Detection with V-DAENY","type":"project"},{"authors":["Enrico Meloni","Raffaele Zippo"],"categories":["Machine Learning"],"content":"This Android app performs face recognition and identification through the smartphone\u0026rsquo;s camera.

In particular, in order to properly interpret the available data, it has become clear that one must go beyond most classic epidemiological models and consider models that, like the recently proposed SIDARTHE, offer a richer description of the stages of infection. The problem of learning the parameters of these models is of crucial importance especially when assuming that they are time-variant, which further enriches their effectiveness.

The simulation (game) in object is collaborative effort where multiple clients generate inputs that drive it. The synchronization layer has to guarantee that each client processes inputs in the correct order so that everyone has a consistent view of the simulation, without ever sharing its state directly.\nWe chose to implement the most strict version of lockstep, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow for the simulation to go on speculatively in case of delays, contrary to most games. We also chose the client-server structure, which should give the lowest delay in most cases. In order to make the library as generic as possible, we chose to use Java Serialization for marshalling/unmarshalling. This gives a huge overhead in terms of bandwidth, and should be reconsidered given the specific application needs.\nGitHub page: https://github.com/MeloniZippoProjects/LockstepLibrary\n","date":1593006417,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593006417,"objectID":"3586e3c94815dae86f2c01ce9d2294e4","permalink":"https://enricomeloni.github.io/project/lockstep-library/","publishdate":"2020-06-24T15:46:57+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/lockstep-library/","section":"project","summary":"A Lockstep Network Synchronization Layer for distributed reliable simulations","tags":["java","concurrent systems","distributed systems","distributed simulations","lockstep"],"title":"Lockstep Library","type":"project"},{"authors":["Enrico Meloni","Raffaele Zippo"],"categories":["Software Development"],"content":"The application is a secure photo sharing service which uses KPABE encryption to enforce access to pictures exclusively to allowed users.

The availability of huge annotated datasets was one of the reasons of this success, if not the most important. However, these datasets have usually been static datasets, with little to no possibility of interaction with the learning agent. Interaction with the environment is critical if one desires to learn in a human-like fashion. Since placing a learning agent in a real environment could be dangerous to things and people, a promising solution is to use Virtual Environments: 3D graphics engines that can simulate real-like scenarios, allowing some degrees of interaction with the environment.\nIn this seminar, we review some of the available Virtual Environments: RAGE, the graphics engine for videogames such as GTA; Habitat AI, a large-scale scenarios Virtual Environment developed by Facebook AI; AI2-Thor, a Virtual Environment with interaction at its core; finally, we explore the pros and cons of building a custom Virtual Environment.","tags":["computer vision","virtual environments","visual agents","unity3D"],"title":"Learning in Virtual Environments","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Marco Di Benedetto","Enrico Meloni","Giuseppe Amato","Fabrizio Falchi","Claudio Gennaro"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"3d5fc965ffc11b5f2478e2e83765041c","permalink":"https://enricomeloni.github.io/publication/di-benedetto-learning-2019/","publishdate":"2020-06-24T13:14:33.260084Z","relpermalink":"/publication/di-benedetto-learning-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Learning safety equipment detection using virtual worlds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Enrico Meloni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"ca3c30d0dfbf3abbaa6b4881e2d4834e","permalink":"https://enricomeloni.github.io/publication/meloni-using-2019/","publishdate":"2020-06-24T13:14:33.259083Z","relpermalink":"/publication/meloni-using-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Using virtual worlds to train an object detector for personal protection equipment","type":"publication"}]
