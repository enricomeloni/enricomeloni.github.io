&lt;p&gt;Experiment Launcher (temporary name) is a scientific utility aimed at storing the experimental results out-putted by a third party software. It allows the user to specify an experiment with a set of parameters andan executable file, and then proceeds to launch the executable and collecting the output. The output is then provided to the user in a human-friendly interface, recording important information such as the date and timewhen the experiment was launched, the parameters, and also the executable version (if version control is used).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WanRaptor is my first job as a Software Engineer and Project Manager with a big enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WanRaptor is an embedded system used to validate an application in a lab environment by emulating bandwidth limitations, latency, packets loss and jitter commonly found in WANs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project involved the development from the ground up of the full-stack Graphical User Interface, including management of hardware resources, installation, secure licensing and user interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WanRaptor is widely used in many laboraties all over United States and further.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lockstep Library</title>
      <link>https://enricomeloni.github.io/project/lockstep-library/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Jun 2020 15:46:57 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://enricomeloni.github.io/project/lockstep-library/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This library was developed as group project for Concurrent and Distributed Systems course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind this project was to implement first-hand a synchronization layer like most multiplayer games use nowadays. The simulation (game) in object is collaborative effort where multiple clients generate inputs that drive it. The synchronization layer has to guarantee that each client processes inputs in the correct order so that everyone has a consistent view of the simulation, without ever sharing its state directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose to implement the most strict version of lockstep, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow for the simulation to go on speculatively in case of delays, contrary to most games. We also chose the client-server structure, which should give the lowest delay in most cases. In order to make the library as generic as possible, we chose to use Java Serialization for marshalling/unmarshalling. This gives a huge overhead in terms of bandwidth, and should be reconsidered given the specific application needs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The application is a secure photo sharing service which uses KPABE encryption to enforce access to pictures exclusively to allowed users. The application is written in C# for the Windows platform and depends on a KPABE command line implementation&lt;/p&gt;
